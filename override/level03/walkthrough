the program is asking the user to input a number which will be subtracted from 0x1337d00d if the result is not between 1-9 and 16-21 it will generate a random number and pass it to decrypt function.
in case it is between in those ranges, the result is passed to decryption function. One of then will give to the user access to /bin/sh



0x1337d00d - 18 = 322424827

./level03
    -> 322424827
