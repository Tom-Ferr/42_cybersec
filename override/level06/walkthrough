the program is asking for a login and a serial. Then, it will cypher the login and finally compares it with the inputed serial. If they match, access to /bin/sh is guaranted!
All we have to to do is to replicate the cypher algorithmn and use it with a long string. The serial is outputed. Use it when level06 asks you for the serial. As login you should use the string that generted the serial.

gcc cypher.c -o sol6
/tmp/sol6
   6249026
./level06
  -> abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
  -> 6249026
